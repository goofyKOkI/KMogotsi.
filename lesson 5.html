                    <h1>The most painful day i've ever experienced</h1>

<p>Yestarday on the 18th of February 2023 i was saying my last goodbyes to my bestfriend.It was soo painful i couldnt't say the speech as the bestfriend i just said"my name is koki and...." i cried.It was soo painful because it was the first time loosing a loved one through death.I panicked when i saw her resting in the coffin ,she looked so stressless,it's like she was having a little peaceful sleep.We went to the graveyard and it was soo sad.Her school mate,family and friends were in a lot of pain and in tears.I was shaking and couldn't hold my tears because the girl i called my bestfriend who was like a sister to me is no longer with me.After sending her to her final resting we went home and i had to go inside the house and see the letters she wrote before taking her life and after i had to leave the funeral unfinished with my mother because we had to go and register in Matsukubyane.When we arrived at Matsukubyane we were late but they managed to register my details.After we had to wait there until 15:00 to catch the school bus,i was alone and crying,my friends tried to comfort me but they couldn't because the pain i am facing is too much and there's literally anything they can do to erase it.Time went and the bus arrived,took us to our houses and when i arrived at my home, i bathed and slept.</p>
